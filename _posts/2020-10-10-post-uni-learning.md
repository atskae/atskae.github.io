My goal to "keep track of my learning on this site" has been an failure. The last time I wrote was back in March - a lot has happened since then:
* COVID-19
* Graduated from university (after six years!)
* Started a full-time job
* Learning about retirement, investing, health insurance, politics, cars, and all this *adult* stuff
* Started drawing more
* Started studying Japanese kanji
* Bought shoes (this is a milestone because I had the same beat up shoes for years)

Because of COVID, all of these were done in the comfort of my home. What a crazy time in history.

I was prompted to return to this "notebook" when I went to clean up my (embarassing) LinkedIn profile recently. It turns out that I haven't updated my profile since my *sophomore* year of college (how did I even get hired). I had a very different career plan in mind back then. It's interesting to see how I went to so many unexpected places after those "design gig" years.

And I regret not writing about any of my process! How did I get from art/graphic design/UI/UX to computer architecture and now quantum computing? What did I learn from all of those journeys?

This entry is just a self-motivating post to hopefully *finally* start documenting all of this learning! So I guess I shall start today.

## Some learning materials I went through recently

### Quantum Computing
I read through a ton of material, but still have trouble building intuition. The best resources that I found:
* 3Blue1Brown on [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&app=desktop), [trigonometry, and complex numbers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDP5CVelJJ1bNDouqrAhVPev)
    * Grant is incredibly talented at explaining intuition. His enthusiasm and clarity has really helped me get over the "I'm too dumb to learn any of this" hurdle
* Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists textbook (Mannucci and Yanofsky)
    * There is also a helpful [Microsoft Research talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM&ab_channel=MicrosoftResearch) with the same title. Both the textbook and talk were very helpful with the computer science to physics transition
    * So far I have felt confident with my understanding (unlike other textbooks) and still feel motivated to keep going!
    * Maybe someday I will be smart enough to get through the famous Nielson and Chuang textbook

#### On-hold
I went through these but didn't fully "get" everything 100%. I will come back to these when my math/quantum mechanics understanding is better
* [Quantum Computing for the Very Curious (QCVC) essays](https://quantum.country/qcvc)
    * This was one of the first memorable resources that I stumbled upon. The narrative-style and flashcard reviews were very innovative and helpful.
* [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
    * The learning by doing (on a real quantum computer!) is a huge plus. Will also revisit their [Qiskit Global Summer School lectures](https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/)

Note to former self: get complex numbers, trigonometry, and linear algebra down first! Then all the formulas and numbers that "randomly" show up unexplained in quantum computing texts won't be so terrifying (hopefully). 

### Retirement, Investing, and Other Adult Finance Stuff
I spent a ton of time watching these [Khan Academy videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance) on finance topics, like 401(k)s, stocks, taxes, ... Does Sal Khan know everything about everything?! I feel blessed to have so much learning material that is accessible and free.

### Japanese
I've been creating Quizlet flashcards of kanji that I see in media (manga, anime, songs), sorting by [grade-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji) and [secondary school kanji](https://www.kanshudo.com/collections/secondary_kanji). [Jisho](https://jisho.org/) has been a really good resource. I think my vocabulary recall needs to be better (I can't just memorize individual kanji). I even joined the Japanese Slack channel at work (hopefully someday I can read what is written!)

### Software Engineering
I've started fiddling with Continous Integration tools, like Jenkins, Concourse, Ansible. I've been experiencing the Agile process for a few months now (I did have a tiny taste of it back in my design days).
