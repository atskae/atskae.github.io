[My goal to keep track of my learning here]({% link _posts/2020-02-28-first-post.md%}) has been a failure. The last time I wrote was more than six months ago - a lot has happened to me since then:
* Graduated from university (after six years!)
* Started a full-time job
* Learning about retirement, investing, cars, and all this *adult* stuff
* Started [drawing more](https://www.instagram.com/atskae/)
* Started studying Japanese kanji
* Bought my own sneakers for the first time (according to my sisters, this is a major milestone for me)

Because of COVID-19, all of these were done in the comfort of my home. What a bizarre time in history.

I was prompted to return to this "notebook" when I went to clean up my LinkedIn profile. It turns out that I haven't updated my profile since my *sophomore* year of college (how did I even get hired), back when my career plan was design. Despite the cringe of reading my old attempts of "professional" writing, the clean up process made me reflect on the many unexpected places that I visited after my design gig years. The unplannedness of it all was quite an adventure.

And I regret not writing about any of my process! What did I learn from my journey from art, graphic design, UI/UX, to computer architecture, security, and now quantum computing? It's all a blur now.

One of my favorites bits from Kevin Kelly's [68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/): "A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier." Let this notebook be a concrete measure and reminder of that :pencil2:

## Quantum Computing Materials
My recent endeavor has been in quantum computing. I went through many reading materials not listed. The biggest challenge for me is building the complete intuition behind quantum with a non-physics background. My favorite resources that I found (and I wish that I started in this order):
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) on [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&app=desktop), [trigonometry, and complex numbers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDP5CVelJJ1bNDouqrAhVPev)
    * Grant is incredible at explaining how to build the *intuition* (which is sadly rare in math eduction). His enthusiasm and clarity really helped me get over the "I'm too dumb to learn any of this" hurdle. His personality is just wonderful.
    * His step-by-step visualizations of mathematics are beautifully animated and described. I wish mathematics was taught this way in school. I appreciate these topics a lot more now. I really regret not starting here.
* Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists textbook (Mannucci and Yanofsky)
    * There is also a good [Microsoft Research talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM&ab_channel=MicrosoftResearch) with the same title
    * The computer science perspective was an excellent introduction and guide into quantum (starting straight from a physics perspective was daunting).
        * Maybe someday I will be smart enough to get through the famous Nielson and Chuang textbook

### Materials On-hold
I went through these a few times but didn't fully "get" everything 100%. For example, as a beginner I was not satisfied with `pi`, `i`, radicals, and `theta` magically appearing in matrices without explanation. I will come back to these when my math/quantum mechanics understanding is stronger:
* [Quantum Computing for the Very Curious (QCVC) essays](https://quantum.country/qcvc)
    * This was one of the first memorable resources that I stumbled upon. The narrative-style and flashcard reviews were very innovative and helpful.
* [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
    * The learning by doing (on a real quantum computer!) is a huge plus. I also hope to engage in the [Qiskit Global Summer School lectures](https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/)

**Note to former self**: get complex numbers, trigonometry, and linear algebra down first! I glanced pass these at first, but then ran into mental roadblocks later. Once all of the fundamental intuition is built, then the formulas and numbers that seem to "randomly" show up unexplained in quantum computing texts won't be so intimidating.

My goal is to digest all of these materials before 2021 and be able to explain how quantum computing works with doodles and illustrations. Los gehts!
