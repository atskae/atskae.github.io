This is my first blog post. Hello World!

I've been meaning to start a blog since, probably around my freshman year in undergrad; it has been on my new year's resolution for years. Now I'm a second-year masters student, finally writing my first blog post. They say that the second best time to plant a tree is now, I guess.

I procrastinated this for many reasons, but the main problem was perfectionism. Back when I was into graphic design, I focused on "perfecting my visual brand design", which missed the whole purpose of a blog. I was so stuck on the design that I never got to building the final product. After getting into computer architecture, I merely slapped the idea of a blog on my resolutions every year and never actually allocated time for it. 

When I became more serious about computer science over the years, I learned the benefit of documenting my code/resources and writing research papers: they are concrete forms of my progress and learning. It's really empowering to look back and see what I have worked on. I've realized that this is the same with my hobbies too. The accumulated piano sheets became a physical form of my progress, and it's really rewarding see a growing list of songs that I've learned how to play over time. Back when I used to draw more often, it was really motivating to look back on all the artwork that I created and see how I improved over the years. A blog would serve the same purpose for my learning. I want to be able to look back in a few months and be able to answer the question: *"what have I been working on?"*.

I don't expect anyone to read this blog; its purpose is solely for myself. But if my writing helps anyone, that would be great too.

Hopefully this won't be my last entry on this blog. Let's see where this goes.
