If you can immediately tell how these names relate to each other:

`500.perlbench_r`, `502.gcc_r`, `520.omnetpp_r`, `503.bwaves_r`, `505.mcf_r`, `510.parest_r`, `538.imagick_r`, `544.nab_r`, `549.fotonik3d_r`.

then you've probably been in computer architecture for a while :smile:

What are these? These are some of the [SPEC 2017 benchmarks](https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/)!

I spent the entire day doodling whatever came to mind when I read each SPEC benchmark name. The amusing part is that the doodles have *nothing* to do with what the benchmark actually does. I haven't done drawn all of them, but here are a few:

### `541.leela_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-leela.png"></div>
Leela from Futurama!

### `507.cactuBSSN_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-cactuBSSN.png"></div>
I always read this name as "cactus".

### `521.wrf_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-wrf.png"></div>
Woof + Arf = Wrf.

Update: I sent this to a friend and she thought the middle dog was saying "wtf" :joy:

### `526.blender_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-blender.png"></div>
I don't think of a literal blender, strangely enough. It's probably because `541.leela_r` is in here.

### `527.cam4_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-cam4.png"></div>
"Cam Four" = Camel...

### `554.roms_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-roms.png"></div>
Roms, rotom? Until today, I thought its name was "rontom".

### `511.povray_r`
<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2020-03-07/SPEC17-povray.png"></div>
A superhero who shoots, povrays? If my advisor was a superhero, he should change his last name to Povray and shoot povrays at bad guys.

:pencil2:

I was supposed to grow some [k-d-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) today, but instead I spent the entire day drawing and listening to Nintendo music. So nostalgic; this is what I used to do in middle school. I was in flow the entire day. I forgot to eat dinner and I even forgot how cold it is in my house. I had a lot of fun!

I'll draw the rest of the benchmarks at some point.
