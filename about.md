Hello, my name is Atsuko!

I recently graduated from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/), where I worked on computer architecture and security research. I am now a software engineer working on quantum computing.

In my free time, I love to:
* [Doodle](https://www.instagram.com/atskae/) :art: (feel free to send me a request!)
* [Read books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100862276-atsuko) :book:
* [Play the piano](https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/browse/series/Pokemon) :musical_keyboard:
* Learn foreign languages (my current endeavor is learning the [Japanese kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji))
