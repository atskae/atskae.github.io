# Blog
A blog of my ramblings in life. I used [this tutorial](https://medium.com/20percentwork/creating-your-blog-for-free-using-jekyll-github-pages-dba37272730a) to help me get started!

## Workflow

### Preview
To see a preview of the blog, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the root directory of this repository. This command runs the blog on the local host. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in a web browser to preview the site. To quit the preview, enter `Control` + `c`.

### Posts
Write blog posts in `_posts/`. Publish the post on the live site by adding files to the respository with `git add <filename>`. Commit changes with `git commit -m <commit message>`, then push the changes to the respository with `git push origin gh-pages`.
